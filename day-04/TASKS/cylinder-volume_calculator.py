# Write the code ↓ to read the radius and height of a cylinder from the user.
radius = float(input("Please, enter the radius of the cylinder: "))

# Be cautious when reading input of various data types.






# Write the code ↓ to calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula V = πr^2h.
volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height
# Formula to calculate the volume (V) of a cylinder:
# V = π * r^2 * h





# Write the code ↓ to display the calculated volume with 2 decimal places.
result = "{:.2f}".format(volume)
print(f"The volume of the cylinder is: {result}sd")
